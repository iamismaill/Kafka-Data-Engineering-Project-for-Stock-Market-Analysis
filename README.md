# Introduction 

As a student learning data engineering, I have successfully completed an end-to-end data engineering project focused on processing real-time stock market data using Apache Kafka. Throughout the project, I had the opportunity to explore a variety of technologies including Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, AWS Glue, Athena, and SQL. By leveraging these tools, I gained hands-on experience in effectively handling real-time data streams, performing data transformations, and querying data using SQL. This project has significantly enhanced my skills as a data engineer and provided me with a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in processing and analyzing real-time stock market data.
